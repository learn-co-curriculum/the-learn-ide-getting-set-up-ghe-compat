Nice! You’re all connected with GitHub. Now, it’s time to start using that “Learn IDE” – short for Integrated Development Environment – that we mentioned in the last lesson. Follow the instructions below to download the IDE.

If you’re thinking, “I have no idea what the Learn IDE is and how I’ll use it,” don’t worry! Below, you’ll find some info on what it does and how it will help you learn to code. In the next lesson, we’ll walk you through your first lab using test-driven-development and the IDE.

## How to Download the Learn IDE:

1. Download the IDE from the button above, or use this [link](https://learn.co/ide-3/download).
2. The software will download (we promise, it’s safe!) 
3. If you are using a Mac, drag the IDE software to your Applications Folder. For more details, check out [this Help Center article](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/moving-the-ide-from-downloads-to-applications-folder-for-osx). If you’re on Windows or Linux, you don’t need to move the IDE to a specific folder. 
4. Don’t worry about opening the IDE yet, we will walk you through opening it and getting started in the next lesson. If you do open it, you'll see a temporary directory - that's fine! Check out the image below to see what that looks like. We’ll walk you through how to get started with a lab in the IDE in the next lesson.

## A Quick Note on the Learn IDE
The Learn IDE  basically gives you a pre-configured terminal with a complete development environment in about a minute. We built the Learn IDE so you can get started coding for real without the hassle of getting your entire computer setup. The Learn IDE is built on top of Atom, the text editor by our amazing friends over at GitHub.

Before we move on, don't forget to download the IDE:
