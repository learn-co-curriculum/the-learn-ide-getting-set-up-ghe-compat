  Nice! You’re all connected with GitHub. Now, it’s time to start using the “Learn IDE” – short for Integrated Development Environment – that we mentioned in the last lesson. Follow the instructions below to download the IDE.
  
  <br>
  <br>

  If you’re thinking, “I have no idea what the Learn IDE is and how I’ll use it,” don’t worry! Below, you’ll find some info on what it does and how it will help you learn to code. In the next lesson, we’ll walk you through your first lab using test-driven-development and the IDE.

  <h1> How to Download the Learn IDE:</h1>
  
  <br>

  1. Download the IDE from the button above, or use this <a href="https://learn.co/ide-3/download"> link</a>.
  <br>
  2. The software will download (we promise, it’s safe!)
  <br>
  3. If you are using a Mac, drag the IDE software to your Applications Folder. For more details, check out <a href="http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/moving-the-ide-from-downloads-to-applications-folder-for-osx"> this Help Center article</a>. If you’re on Windows or Linux, you don’t need to move the IDE to a specific folder.
  <br>
  4. Open the IDE, and log in with your Learn account. You'll see a temporary directory - that's fine! Check out the image below to see what that looks like. We’ll walk you through how to get started with opening a lab in the IDE in the next lesson.
